title: Authentication
---

Zero uses a JWT-based flow to authenticate connections to zero-cache.

You configure Zero with a `jwtSecret` and then use that secret to encode the userID. This encoded JWT should be sent to your web client and on to Zero, who sends it to zero-cache. 

zero-cache then decodes the JWT to obtain the userâ€™s ID, and uses it as an input to [permission rules](permissions).
