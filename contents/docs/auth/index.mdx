title: Authentication
---

Zero uses a JWT-based flow to authenticate connections to zero-cache.

You configure `zero-cache` with a `ZERO_JWT_SECRET` environment variable. During login, your API server encodes the userID and any other useful information into a JWT and signs it with this secret.

The JWT should be sent to your web client and then into the `Zero` client using the `jwtSecret` option.

`Zero` sends the JWT to `zero-cache` during connection, who decodes it to use as an input to [permission rules](permissions).
