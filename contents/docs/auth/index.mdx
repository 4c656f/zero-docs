title: Authentication
---

Zero uses a JWT-based flow to authenticate connections to zero-cache.

In order to validate JWTs, `zero-cache` must be configured with a `ZERO_JWT_SECRET` environment variable. During login, your API server encodes the userID and any other useful information into a JWT and signs it with this same secret.

The JWT for a user should be sent to your web client and then passed into the `Zero` constructor using the `auth` option.

```ts
const zero = new Zero({
  ...,
  auth: token, // your JWT
  userID, // this must match the `sub` field from `token`
});
```

The `zero` instance will send the JWT to `zero-cache` on connect. `Zero-cache` verifies and decodes the JWT to use as an input to [permission rules](permissions).
