title: Connecting to Postgres
---

In the future, Zero will work with many different backend databases. Today only Postgres is supported. Specifically, Zero requires Postgres v15.0 or higher, and support for [logical replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication.html).

Here are some common Postgres options and what we know about their support level:

| Postgres                          | Support Status                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Postgres.app                      | ‚úÖ                                                                                                              |
| AWS RDS                           | ‚úÖ                                                                                                              |
| postgres:16.2-alpine docker image | ‚úÖ                                                                                                              |
| [Fly.io](http://Fly.io) Postgres  | ‚úÖ                                                                                                              |
| Supabase, Neon, Render, Heroku    | ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è¬†Partial support with the `auto-reset` flag. Schema changes trigger full resync. See ‚ÄúSchema Changes‚Äù, below. |
| AWS Aurora                        | ‚ùå¬†Unsupported due to SQL differences. Let us know if you need this ‚Äì we can likely figure it out.              |

## Schema Changes

Zero uses Postgres ‚Äú[Event Triggers](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createeventtrigger.html)‚Äù to implement high-quality, efficient [schema migration](migrations). Event Triggers typically requires superuser access to Postgres.

Hosted Postgres provides like Supabase and Neon don‚Äôt provide superuser access.

Zero can still works without Event Triggers, but for correctness, any schema change triggers a full rebuild of all server-side and client-side state. For small databases (< 1GB) this can be OK, but for bigger databases we recommend choosing a provider that grants access to Event Triggers.

To enable support for these databases, use the [`auto-reset`](/docs/zero-cache-config) flag.

## Configuration

The Postgres `wal_level` config parameter has to be set to `logical`. You can check what level your pg has with this command:

```bash
psql -c 'SHOW wal_level'
```

If it doesn‚Äôt output `logical` then you need to change the wal level. To do this, run:

```bash
psql -c "ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = 'logical';"
```

Then restart Postgres. On most pg systems you can do this like so:

```bash
data_dir=$(psql -t -A -c 'SHOW data_directory')
pg_ctl -D "$data_dir" restart
```

After your server restarts, show the `wal_level` again to ensure it has changed:

```bash
psql -c 'SHOW wal_level'
```
