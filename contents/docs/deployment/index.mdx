title: Deploying Zero
---

To deploy a Zero app, you need to:

1. Deploy your backend database. Most standard Postgres hosts [work with Zero](connecting-to-postgres).
1. Deploy `zero-cache`. We provide a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocicorp/zero) that should work with any Docker host.
1. Deploy your frontend. You can use any hosting service like Vercel or Netlify.

## Scalability

<Note type="warning" heading="`zero-cache` is Currently Single-Node">
This pains us as much as it does you, because `zero-cache` is designed to be horizontally scalable.

In fact, we already have zbugs [running on five nodes in production](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/blob/main/prod/templates/template.yml#L117) – we just haven't finished the API and docs yet.

We will address this in early 2025. See [Roadmap](roadmap) for more information.

</Note>

A single reasonably-sized `zero-cache` node can handle a fairly large number of users – thousands of concurrents or more depending on what they're doing.

But it's not infinitely scalable, and updating `zero-cache` today will take down your service for a minute or so while the Docker container restarts. We'll have this fixed soon.

## Topology

While `zero-cache` is single-node, you should deploy it close to your database to minimize sync latency. In the future, you will be able to deploy `zero-cache` in multiple regions to provide low-latency access to users around the world.

## Configuration

The `zero-cache` image is configured via environment variables. See [zero-cache Config](./zero-cache-config) for available options.

## Schema Deployment

`zero-cache` needs a copy of your [`zero-schema.json`](./zero-schema) because it is used to enforce permissions.

You can deploy it as a plain file, using the `ZERO_SCHEMA_FILE` env var. For convenience, we also support putting the schema string itself directly in an env var, using `ZERO_SCHEMA_JSON`.

## Example: Deploying to Fly.io

Let's deploy the [Quickstart](quickstart) app to [Fly.io](https://fly.io). We'll use Fly.io for both the database and `zero-cache`.

### Setup Quickstart

Go through the [Quickstart](quickstart) guide to get the app running locally.

### Setup Fly.io

Create an account on [Fly.io](https://fly.io) and [install the Fly CLI](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/install/).

### Create Postgres app

<Note type="warning">
  **Note:** Fly.io requires app names to be unique across all Fly.io users.
  Change the `INITIALS` environment variable below to something unique.
</Note>

```bash
INITIALS=aa
PG_APP_NAME=$INITIALS-zstart-pg

PG_PASSWORD="$(dd if=/dev/urandom count=1 2>/dev/null | uuencode -m - | tr -cd '[:alpha:]' | cut -c-16)"

fly postgres create \
  --name $PG_APP_NAME \
  --region lax \
  --initial-cluster-size 1 \
  --vm-size shared-cpu-2x \
  --volume-size 40 \
  --password=$PG_PASSWORD
```

### Seed Upstream database

Populate the database with initial data and set its `wal_level` to `logical` to support replication to `zero-cache`. Then restart the database to apply the changes.

```bash
(cat ./docker/seed.sql; echo "\q") | fly pg connect -a $PG_APP_NAME
echo "ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = logical; \q" | fly pg connect -a $PG_APP_NAME
fly postgres restart --app $PG_APP_NAME
```

### Create `zero-cache` Fly.io app

```bash
CACHE_APP_NAME=$INITIALS-zstart-cache
fly app create $CACHE_APP_NAME
```

### Publish `zero-cache`

Create a `fly.toml` file. We'll copy the `zero-schema.json` into the toml file to pass it to the server as an environment variable.

```bash
CONNECTION_STRING="postgres://postgres:$PG_PASSWORD@$PG_APP_NAME.flycast:5432"

cat <<EOF > fly.toml
app = "$CACHE_APP_NAME"
primary_region = 'lax'

[build]
image = "registry.hub.docker.com/rocicorp/zero:latest"

[http_service]
internal_port = 4848
force_https = true
auto_stop_machines = 'off'
min_machines_running = 1

[[http_service.checks]]
grace_period = "10s"
interval = "30s"
method = "GET"
timeout = "5s"
path = "/"

[[vm]]
memory = '2gb'
cpu_kind = 'shared'
cpus = 2

[mounts]
source = "sqlite_db"
destination = "/data"

[env]
ZERO_REPLICA_FILE = "/data/sync-replica.db"
ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB="${CONNECTION_STRING}/zstart?sslmode=disable"
ZERO_CVR_DB="${CONNECTION_STRING}/zstart_cvr?sslmode=disable"
ZERO_CHANGE_DB="${CONNECTION_STRING}/zstart_cdb?sslmode=disable"
ZERO_JWT_SECRET="secretkey"
LOG_LEVEL = "debug"
ZERO_SCHEMA_JSON = """$(cat zero-schema.json)"""
EOF
```

Then publish `zero-cache`:

```bash
fly deploy
```

### Use Remote `zero-cache`

```bash
cat <<EOF > .env
VITE_PUBLIC_SERVER='https://${CACHE_APP_NAME}.fly.dev/'
EOF
```

Now restart the frontend to pick up the env change, and refresh the app. You can stop your local database and `zero-cache` as we're not using them anymore. Open the web inspector to verify the app is talking to the remote `zero-cache`!

You can deploy the frontend to any standard hosting service like Vercel or Netlify, or even to Fly.io!

### Deploy Frontend to Vercel

If you've followed the above guide and deployed `zero-cache` to fly, you can simply run:

```sh
vercel deploy --prod \
  -e ZERO_JWT_SECRET="secretkey" \
  -e VITE_PUBLIC_SERVER='https://${CACHE_APP_NAME}.fly.dev/'
```

to deploy your frontend to Vercel.

Explaining the arguments above --

- `ZERO_JWT_SECRET` - The secret to create and verify JWTs. This is the same secret that was used when deploying zero-cache to fly.
- `VITE_PUBLIC_SERVER` - The URL the frontend will call to talk to the zero-cache server. This is the URL of the fly app.
