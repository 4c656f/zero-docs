## zbugs

zbugs is a complete issue tracker in the style of Linear built with Zero.

Not just a demo app, this is the Rocicorpâ€™s actual issue tracker. We use it everyday and depend on it. When Zero launches publicly this will be our public issue tracker, not GitHub.

</Note>

Same as `zero-hello` and `zero-hello-solid` above, but demonstrates Cloudflare Durable Objects integration.

This sample runs `zero-client` within a Durable Object and monitors changes to a Zero query. This can be used to do things like send notifications, update external services, etc.
