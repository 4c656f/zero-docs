## Install

```bash
npm install @rocicorp/zero@0.4
```

## Breaking changes

The `or` changes modified the client/server protocol. You’ll need to restart zero-cache and clear browser data after updating.

## Features

- Added `or` , `and` , and `not` to ZQL ([documentation](https://www.notion.so/Reading-Data-with-ZQL-12b3bed895458114bde7ea73407b6926?pvs=21)).
- Added `query.run()` method ([documentation](https://www.notion.so/Reading-Data-with-ZQL-12b3bed895458114bde7ea73407b6926?pvs=21)).

## Fixes

- Use `batch()` method in zero-solid to improve performance when multiple updates happen in same frame.  To take advantage of this you must use the `createZero` helper from `@rocicorp/zero/solid`, instead of instantiating Zero directly.  See the solid [sample app](https://github.com/rocicorp/hello-zero-solid/blob/main/src/main.tsx#L16).
- Postgres tables that were reserved words in SQLite but not Postgres caused crash during replication.
- `LIKE` was not matching correctly in the case of multiline subjects.
- Upstream database and zero database can now be same Postgres db (don’t need separate ports).
